// NOTE: report composition goes through the Semantic Composer path
// (`selectComposer` + `composeReport` in composer.ts). An external composer is
// gated behind explicit, payload-matching consent at the API layer. There is
// deliberately NO ungated `selectProvider` helper — that would bypass consent.
